# 🎉 Contributing to Welcomancer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Welcomancer**, a Python-based Discord bot focused on customizable onboarding and lightweight moderation for single-guild servers.

## 🧭 Project Scope

Welcomancer is intentionally minimal. Features should:

* Be useful for small to mid-sized community servers
* Require little to no external hosting infrastructure
* Respect server autonomy and transparency
* Avoid feature creep or platform overreach

If your idea aligns with these principles, we’d love to hear it.

## 🧵 Code Style Guidelines
>*Welcomancer’s style conventions are here to keep the project clean, readable, and easy to maintain.
>*This is a space where learning and collaborative growth are welcome
> Here’s what to follow:
* **Python 3.10+:** Ensures access to newer features like structural pattern matching and type hinting improvements
* **Use `snake_case` for variables and functions:** Makes your code consistent with the best practices of Python's style guide (PEP8) and easier for others to read
* **Use double quotes for strings:** Keeps formatting uniform and reduces diff noise in pull requests making line-by-line changes easy to decipher
* **Keep functions short and modular:** Easier to understand, rest, and reuse; avoids spaghetti code and mental fatigue
* **Prefer built-in types and libraries over external dependencies unless justified:** Reduces dependencies, simplifies installation, and keeps the bot more portable and transparet
>Following these conventions helps everyone learn to build muscle memory for clean code and makes the entire codebase more welcoming for collaboration from all experience levels.
