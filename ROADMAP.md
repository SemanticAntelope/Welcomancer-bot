## 🧠 Philosophy

**Welcomancer** is a personal project that is built for personal servers that value clarity, customization, and stability over scale. It avoids bloat and hidden behavior, focusing instead on transparency and simplicity. The goal is to give server admins useful automation without overcomplicating setup or control.

> If you fork or extend this project, you're encouraged to document your own philosophy in your fork’s README. Bots carry values, please code clearly.
